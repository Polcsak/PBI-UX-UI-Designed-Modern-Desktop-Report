# PBI-UX-UI-Designed-Modern-Desktop-Report
This is a sales dashboard I created as part of a course on **UX design for Power BI dashboards**. I followed the training on Udemy ([Modern Power BI Report Build](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-powerbi-report-build/learn/lecture/38359380?start=0#overview)) to improve how I design and present data in a clear, user-friendly way.
