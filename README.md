# ðŸ“ˆ Sales Analysis Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ What is this about?

This is a sales dashboard I created as part of a course on **UX design for Power BI dashboards**. I followed the training on Udemy ([Modern Power BI Report Build](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-powerbi-report-build/learn/lecture/38359380?start=0#overview)) to improve how I design and present data in a clear, user-friendly way.

The goal of the project was to combine clean visuals with effective storytelling â€” something that helps users make quick decisions without feeling overwhelmed by too much detail.

## ðŸ“Š What it shows

- Total sales, profit, and order volume  
- Monthly and yearly performance trends  
- Regional sales breakdown (map view)  
- Category and product-level analysis  
- Key KPIs with clear visual hierarchy

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I made it

The main reason was to level up my dashboard design skills. I wanted to go beyond just building something that works â€” and instead focus on **layout, user flow, consistency, and readability**.

This dashboard is useful as:

- A **practice project** to apply UX principles in Power BI  
- A **portfolio piece** to showcase clean layout and design logic  
- A **template** that could be reused for similar sales reporting in real-world scenarios
